# mexes_grounddecal_autoplacer
Auto places groundecal metal patches on SpringRTS maps.

Download this repo as an archive and extract to your map's .sdd folder. Works best with lua metal configs. Should work with old-school image metalmaps as well.

Also includes crystal featurering from Anarchid, enable it by uncommenting  --object	= "crystal.dae",  in crystalring.lua

Includes /luaui/widgets/dbg_mouse_to_mex_portable.lua , for creating lua metal configs. Example config can be seen in /mapconfig/
